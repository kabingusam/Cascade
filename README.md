### General Info
***

This is a job/project posting web application where users are able to post developer jobs/projects, the location where in this case the job is being offered, the company name, the relevant skills or programming languages used in the project, a brief description and also upload the logo of the projects/company.

Also users are able to create accounts where they will have the privilege to access any listing that they post, delete or even edit it.

### The Story

Cascade was motivated by the desire to enable developers to experience ease in job finding and also companies in job posting. Having a simplistic approach in development and also implementation, Cascade thrives in simplicity as its core aspect.

### Getting Started

Getting started is actually very simple. Even without an account, one is able to see the listed jobs but in order for one to able to post, account creation is necessary.
